Login:

My microblog allows the user little functionality without logging in. All
you can do is look at the posts of every user and the users themselves. Logging in
allows the user to follow other and post messages. The logged in user can only
edit and delete their own information and posts. Logging out returns the user
to the previous state before being logged in.

Post:

Posting adds a post to the current user that posted it. This post goes on their
profile and can later be edited or deleted. Users who follow this user will see
this post on their home screen. Other users cannot edit or delete your posts.

Follow:

Following another user causes their posts to show up on your home screen. It also
adds them to your following page so you can keep track of the users you are following.
You can remove them from this list at any time. When you follow a user, you will
now show up on their followers page, and they can remove you at any time. You cannot
remove users from another user's followers or following list.
